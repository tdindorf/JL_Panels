<ol><li>	One hundred grams of water at 70 °C is poured into 300 g of water at 20 °C.<br/>The mixture is sufficiently isolated from its environment so that all heat transfer is between these quantities of water, and no heat is transferred to the environment.<br/>
	Compute the temperature at which thermal equilibrium occurs.
</li><li>	An aluminum block with a mass of 100 g is heated to 120°C and dropped into 1000 g of water which is initially at 20 °C.<br/>
	Compute the temperature at thermal equilibrium of the mixture, assuming negligible heat transfer to the environment.
</li><li>	Compute the heat required to change 10 g of ice at -20 °C to 10 g of steam at 120 °C.<br/>
	Assume constant pressure and use 0.5 cal/g C° as an approximate value for the specific heats of ice and steam.<br/>
	Use latent heats of fusion and vaporization given in Panels 16 and 17.
</li><li>	Twenty-five grams of ice at 0 °C are dropped into 200 g of water initially at 35 °C.<br/>Assume isolation from the environment, and compute the temperature of thermal equilibrium.<br/>
	Use 80 cal/g as the heat of fusion for ice.
</li><li>	A 0.005 kg lead bullet has a speed of 1000 m/s.<br/>Compute the increase in the temperature of the bullet when it strikes a target if 1/50 of its kinetic energy is used to heat the bullet.<br/>
	Find the specific heat of lead in Pan_14.
</li><li>	In the figure, water is shown boiling at a constant pressure provided by the atmosphere on the movable piston (assume that the weight of the piston is negligible).<br/>
	<b>Q</b> is the heat transferred to the system from the burner flame, and <b>W</b> is the work done by the gas as it expands.<br/>
	Experiment shows that at a pressure of 1 atm (1.01 x 10<sup>5</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup>), 1 g of water at 100 °C occupies 1240 x 10<sup>-6</sup> m<sup>3</sup>.<br/>
	Compute the increase in the internal energy of 1 g of water when it changes from water at 100 °C to steam at the same temperature.
</li><li>	The inside face of a glass window pane is maintained at a constant 25 °C.<br/>
	The temperature outside remains at 10 °C for a period of 3 hours.<br/>The area of the window is 1 m<sup>2</sup>, the thickness of the window is 0.3 cm.<br/>
	Compute the heat transferred from inside to outside in this time.
</li><li>	A black-body radiator has a total surface area of 3 x 10<sup>-2</sup> m<sup>2</sup> and is maintained at a temperature of 127 °C for 30 minutes.<br/>
	Compute the rate at which it emits radiant energy.<br/>Compute the total amount of energy it radiates in this time.
