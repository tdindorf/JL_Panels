	<p>We can now summarize the assumptions made so far:<br/>(the number and order are not important; different sources sometimes combine these statements into fewer, sometimes split
		thim into more numerous ones)</p>
	
	<ol>
		<i>The first four assumptions are part of a more general <b>kinetic theory of matter</b></i>
		<li>Matter consists of particles; the total mass of these particle is the mass of the substance/object.</li>
		<li>These particles are in constant, random, and rapid motion, as a result of which they collide among themselves and (in case of a fluid) with the walls of the container. </li>
		<li>All these collisions are perfectly elastic.</li>
		<li>The average kinetic energy of the particles depends only on the absolute temperature of the system.</li>
		
		<br/><i>The next assumptions are applicable to <b>gases only</b>, and complete the <b>kinetic theory of gases</b>:</i>
		<li>In a gas, the total volume of the individual particles is negligible compared to the volume occupied by the gas (= the average distance separating the gas particles is large compared to their size);</li>
	<li>Except during collisions, the interactions among molecules are negligible (= they exert no long-range (a.k.a. <i><b>inter-molecular</b></i>) forces on one another);</li>
		<li>The duration of individual collisions is negligible when compared to the time between successive collisions.</li>
		
	</ol>
	<p>(One can argue about whether (4) is an assumption or a deduction)</p>
