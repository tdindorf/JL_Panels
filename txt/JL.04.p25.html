<ol><li>Compute the change in the entropy of 1 g of ice at 0 °C when it has changed to 1 g of water at 0 °C.
	</li><li>A metal rod is in contact at one end with a body maintained at a constant temperature of 300 K and at the other end with a body maintained at a constant temperature of 500 K.<br/>Consider the two bodies and the rod as an isolated system, and compute the change in the entropy of the system when 1500 cal are conducted through the rod.
	</li><li>A silver rod is in contact at one end with a body maintained at 250 °C and at the other end with a body maintained at 50 °C.<br/>The rod is 10 cm long and has a cross-sectional area of 0.01 cm<sup>2</sup>.<br/>How much heat is conducted through the rod in 5 minutes?
