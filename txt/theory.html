		<p>In the next few sections we will examine certain <b>laws</b>, and a <b>theory</b> used to <b>explain</b> them.</p>
		<p>The words “law” and “theory” mean many different things to many people.
		Here we will use the term <i>(physical) <b>law</i></b> to designate any <center><i>quantitative or qualitative <b>description</b>, in words or in mathematical symbols, of a <b>regularity</b> observed to exist among the <b>properties</b> of things.</i></center></p>
		<p>In your study of physics you have already encountered such laws.
		The mathematical descriptions of the total momentum of a closed system, <center>Σ (m v) = constant</center>and of the period of the simple pendulum, <center>T = 2π √(l/g)</center>are just two examples.</p>
		<p><center>"The diffusion of gases is rapid relative to the diffusion of liquids or solids"</center>and<center>"the planets move around the Sun in elliptical paths"</center>are non-quantitative descriptions of physical phenomena we can call laws under the meaning assumed here.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>In general, <center><i>physical laws result from our <b>observations</b> of <b>physical properties</b> and refer to things and events that can themselves be <b>directly observed</b> (and <b>measured</b>).</i></center></p>
		
		<p>We shall use the word <b><i>theory</i></b> (physicists sometimes use the word <b><i>model</i></b> instead) to designate a set of <b>assumptions</b> which are used to <b>explain</b>, among other things, the laws we formulate from our observations.
			Such theories very often <b>assume the existence</b> of entities (<i>atoms, electrons, light corpuscles a.k.a. photons</i>, etc.) which are <b>not readily observed</b>, or in fact <b>not observable in any direct sense</b> at all (<i>virtual particles</i>, <i>quarks</i>, <i>black holes</i>, <i>Big Bang</i> etc).
			The <i><b>atomic</b> theory</i> assumes that all matter consists of invisible particles called atoms.
			Atoms are not directly observable, but the assumption that they exist enables us to explain what we observe to happen in chemical reactions.
			The phenomena of static electricity are explained by the assumptions of the <i><b>electron</b> theory</i> even though no one has ever seen an electron.
			"Children of blue-eyed parents are blue-eyed" is a statement of a physical law.
			"Chromosomes are composed of different kinds of genes which are associated with inherited traits like colour of eyes, hair, etc.," is one assumption of a theory developed to explain the law.

		<p><center><b>Theories</b> (or <b>models</b>) developed here consist of <b>sets of assumptions</b> which are <b>useful in explaining</b> what we actually <b>observe and describe</b> in physical <b>laws</b>.</center></p>
		<p>	The notions of physical <i>law</i> and <i>theory</i> are subjects of much discussion in the history and philosophy of science, and the definitions used here cannot claim to be complete or categorical.</p>
