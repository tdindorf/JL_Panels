<p> The three gas laws, Boyle-Mariotte (p-V), Charles (V-T), and Gay-Lussac (p-T), allow us to predict the future state of a confined gas, but offer no insight into the underlying mechanism</p><p>After analyzing the results of (one of many) Gay-Lussac’s experiments on the chemistry of gases (the <i>law of <b>combining volumes</b></i>) Avogadro postulated in 1811 that, <i>assuming</i> matter (including gases) consisted of particles, <center><i>equal volumes of gases at equal temperatures and pressures must contain equal numbers of particles</i> (<i><b>Avogadro’s law</b></i>, or <i>the law of <b>equal volumes</b></i>)</center></p>
<p>Not until a century later (1910), when R. Millikan measured the charge of an electron, was it first possible to calculate this number, now known as the <i><b>Avogadro</b> constant</i>, <b>N</b><sub>A</sub>.</p>
<p>We know now that, for <u>any</u> gas at 0 °C (273.15 K) and 1 atm (101.325 × 10<sup>3</sup> Pa), a volume of 22.414 × 10<sup>-3</sup> m<sup>3</sup> contains <b>N</b><sub>A</sub> = 6.02 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles.<p>
<hr/>
<p>What Avogadro appeared to be most interested in, however, were the consequences of his realization: that, unlike in solids or liquids, <center><i>the density of a gas was a direct measure of the mass of its individual particles.</i></center>Thus the molecular mass of any solid or liquid could be determined by <ol><li>converting it to a gas (boil, melt and boil, or sublimate), then </li><li>comparing the density of the vapor to that of hydrogen (used as the ‘unit’) under the same pressure and temperature,</li></ol></p>
