<p>Each of these figures represents a container in which a gas is confined.
	<ul>
		<li>Fig. 1 is a container with a fixed volume. </li>
		<li>Fig. 2 and 3 have a movable piston, so that the gas expands or is compressed at constant pressure. </li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>The containers in Figs. 1 and 2 are made of a material through which heat passes quite readily i.e. <i>heat <b>conductors</b></i>. </li>
		<li>In Fig. 3, the container and piston are made of materials called <i>heat <b>insulators</b></i>, through which heat transfers negligibly. </li>
	</ul>
