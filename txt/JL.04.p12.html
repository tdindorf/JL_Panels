	<p>We can now summarize the <u>assumptions</u> made so far:
	<br/>(the number and order are not important; different sources sometimes combine these statements into fewer, 
	sometimes split them into more numerous ones)</p>
	
	<ol>
		<p><i>The first few assumptions are part of a more general <b>kinetic theory of matter:</b></i></p>
	<li>Matter consists of particles; the total mass of these particle is the mass of the substance/object.</li>
		<li>These particles are in constant, random motion, as a result of which they collide among themselves and (in case of a fluid) with the walls of the container. </li>
		<li>All these collisions are perfectly elastic.</li>
		<li>The average kinetic energy of the particles depends only on the absolute temperature of the system.</li>
		<p>[One can argue about whether (4) is an <i>assumption</i> or a <i>deduction</i>]</p>
		
		<p><i>The next assumptions are applicable to <b>gases only</b>, and complete the <b>kinetic theory of gases</b></i>:</p>
		<p>All of the following are <b>negligible</b> (= zero) in a gas:</p>
		<li>The total volume of the individual particles <u>compared to</u> the volume occupied by the gas
			<br/>(= the average distance separating the gas particles is large compared to their size)
		<br/>(= the particles are treated as <i>point masses</i>: they have a mass, but no size);</li>
		<li>The interactions among molecules, <u>except</u> during collisions
			<br/>(= they exert no long-range (a.k.a. <i><b>inter-molecular</b></i>) forces on one another)
		<br/>(= between collisions particles travel with uniform velocity);</li>
		<li>The duration of individual collisions <u>compared to</u> the time between successive collisions
		<br/>(= all changes in momenta, and transfers of kinetic enegy, are instantaneous).</li>
